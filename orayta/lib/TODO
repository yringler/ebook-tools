RangeIterator:I have no clue why I can't create a refrence "ValueT &" with
"return current;". Because I can't do this, I can't really be forward iterator.

The easiest thing to do is to be an input_iterator, but that flops -- something
about missing a find_end() function...

In the mean time, everything works, and "$const$ ValueT operator*() , so any 
attempt to set *current will fail at compile time, as the returned ValueT will
be const.

But I still think the code is pretty clean and non-kludgey, despite haveing
these annoying problems...
