NOTE: Due to weird template stuff, all the .cpp files are #included-ed
into their respective header files. I didn't #ifdef etc protect the .cpp files,
so an attempt to compile them will end in error.


Concept: one string is a comment on another string
Implement: Comment
	(client has direct access to members)
  
	concept: lets you know what substring its commenting on
	implement: std::string on
  
	concept: the comment - std::string comment
  
	concept: access commented on and not commented on parts of source string
		separately at will
	implement: iterators to source string hold location of beginning and
		(past the) end of what commented on


Concept: Bind a comment to source text, ie set its iterators to the place in
	the source text that is being commented on
Implement: Binder

Concept: iterator which only allows itself to be on a value within a 
      given range ( e.g. letters)
Implement: RangeIterator<typename Iterator>


Concept: A "fuzzy" binder, not considering characters outside a given range to
	be reason to say that the comment isn't commenting on that string
Implement: LooseBinder ( maybe make onString take a template arg of iterator
        to use for compare?...would shrink code size...TZ"I )
