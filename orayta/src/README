===========

NOTE: Due to weird template stuff, all the .cpp files are #included-ed
into their respective header files. I didn't #ifdef etc protect the .cpp files,
so an attempt to compile them will end in error.


Concept: one string is a comment on another string
Implement: struct Comment
    client has direct access to members
  
    concept: lets you know what is the substring that its commenting on
              This can be seen as a request
    implement: std::string on
  
    concept: the comment - std::string comment
  
   concept: access commented on and not commented on parts of source 
          string
 separately at will
    implement: iterators (similar to pointers) to source string hold 
            location of beginning 
and end of what commented on


Concept: a string which is being commented on, which can attach a link 
        to itself, meaning  set the iterators of the Comment
Implement: class OnString
	concept: set what string should be connected to
	implement: set(string)
	notes: copies to a “pointer to const String"
	      : has an intersting ability that I'll hopefully document later


Concept: iterator which only allows itself to be on a value within a 
      given range ( e.g. letters)
Implement: RangeIterator<typename Iterator>


Concept: an Attach string which, when finding where comment.on is located in the
	source string, is “fuzzy”, not considering values outside a given range to make
	or break a match
Implement: LooseOnString ( maybe make onString take a template arg of iterator
        to use for compare?...would shrink code size...TZ”I )
